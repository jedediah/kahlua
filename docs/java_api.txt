This document describes what things to consider when using Kahlua inside your java application

Garbage collection
------------------
In the original Lua, garbage collection was done inside the Lua engine, which meant that it could not
expose its objects to C directly since it would mean the garbage collector wouldn't know which objects had
become unreachable.
In Kahlua, garbage collection is handled fully by Java,
which means that you can access and interact with objects in the Lua engine just as any other java object.

Userdata
--------
The original Lua has userdata to support extending it with useful custom types. Kahlua also has this.
You can pass any object into the lua engine, and by setting a metatable for it you can even use ordinary
operators on them. Metatables are set pre class, and not per object.
There's a very simple example on usage in se.krka.kahlua.test.UserdataArray

LuaState.setUserdataMetatable(Class c, LuaTable metatable)
Use this to assign a metatable to a custom type.
Use null as metatable to unset.

Differences compared to standard Lua
------------------------------------

All metatable keys except for __gc are supported.
__gc is unsupported because CLDC 1.1 doesn't have a way to report when an
object gets garbage collected.

Strings
-------
Kahlua assumes the equality is identity for strings:
In practice this means that all strings that you pass to Kahlua must
have be interned. You may also assume that all strings that are values inside Kahlua are interned.

Thread safety
-------------
Kahlua is not thread safe in any way. Do not attempt to use a LuaState concurrently from different threads.
Sharing LuaTables are possible, but you have to manually ensure that no two threads try to access a LuaTable
at the same time.

Native functions
----------------
You most likely want to provide more functions for your lua environment to use.
Any object that implements the JavaFunction interface may be passed to Kahlua.
See the classes in se.krka.kahlua.stdlib for examples on usage. StringLib is probably the easiest to take a look at.

Loading Lua code
----------------
Kahlua does not come with a Lua compiler (unlike standard Lua).
Instead Kahlua can load precompiled lua 5.1b bytecode.

Use luac -o output.lbc input.lua to compile a lua source file to bytecode.
You can then use LuaPrototype.loadBytecode to get a lua closure.
See se.krka.kahlua.test.Test to see examples of usage

Supported Lua versions
----------------------
Kahlua only supports Lua 5.1 bytecode, without any of the 5.0 compat options.
